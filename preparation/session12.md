  * Read chapter one of _Building Microservices_ to understand what microservices are and what issues in software engineering and system integration their attempt to tackle, see Building_Microservices_Chap1.pdf.
  * Watch the first 10.5 minutes of Peter Bourgon's talk on _"Go + Microservices"_, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXEjAwNWays. Amongst others, he provides popular definitions of what a _Microservice_ is and what are the issues of service-oriented architectures based on microservices.
  * For some information on how to model services, especially when and how to split subsystems, read in chapter three of _Building Microservices_, see Building_Microservices_Chap3.pdf.
  * Chapter 11 of _Architechting for Scale_, provides some more patterns for splitting into subsystems, see `Architecting_for_Scale_Chap11.pdf`
  * Read on different deployment target in the first part of chapter nine of _Go in Practice_, see Go_in_Practice_chap9_part.pdf.
  * Conclusively, chapter twelve of _Building Microservices_ provides an architechtural overview  over microservices and corresponding requirements, see Building_Microservices_Chap12.pdf.
